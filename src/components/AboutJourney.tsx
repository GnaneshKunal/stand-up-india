					    the institutional credit structure to reach out to the underserved sector of people
					    such as Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe and Women entrepreneurs so as to enable
					    them to participate in the economic growth of the nation. The scheme will benefit
					    atleast 2.5 lakh borrowers through 1.25 lakh bank branch network located across
					    the country.</p>

					    Dalits could get loan of Rs. 368 crore in Prakasam district alone, with each bank branch directed to give loan of up to Rs. 1 crore to one SC/ST member and one woman entrepreneur, he said.

					    SC/STs and women entrepreneurs would be provided hand-holding, including training and marketing, to run their enterprises successfully, he added.

				     In the wake of protests that the Union government faces from Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes communities, Kamble, who trained as a civil engineer and is an entrepreneur, said schemes such as Mudra and Stand up India have benefited the marginalised communities. </p>

The administration of Chittoor district has allotted more than 520 vehicles including cars and JCB machines worth about Rs 100 crore.
					    Loans given under Stand-Up India may be used in manufacturing, services or trading sector. In case of non-individual enterprises, at least 51 per cent of the shareholding and controlling stake should be held by either an SC/ST or woman entrepreneur. The Chittoor district has delivered 520 units (vehicles) while more than 98 applications are under process that will be delivered by next month.
					    Chittoor district is likely to touch the 600 units mark by next month. Vijayanagaram takes the bottom place having delivered only 74 units.
					    Chittoor district collector P.S. Pradyumna is very keen on making the scheme a success and holding video conferences with the concerned authorities at least twice a week. Banks are also giving loan in less than a month. The beneficiary can get loan without collateral security. Speaking to DC, Mr Pradyumna said, "We are working hard to create more opportunities to the poor. This scheme is to encourage more entrepreneurs. The beneficiaries are really happy with the scheme. A car similar to the one that I am using is supplied to the beneficiaries."</p>
